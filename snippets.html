                We arrive by plane at Baltra Island and transfer to the dock to board the Santa Cruz II where we receive
                our welcome introductory briefing and lunch.
              </p>
              <p>
                After lunch and your introductory briefing on board, Santa Cruz II will relocate only four nautical miles
                from Baltra, next to Mosquera Islet, a small volcanic uplift between Baltra and North Seymour. The island
                is a long and narrow sand bank surrounded by lava reefs. Our groups will approach the island from its
                western shore, a long shallow reef, the perfect rookery for young sea lions. After a wet landing, our
                guides will lead you past the sea lion colonies, where you will learn more about the fragile marine and
                terrestrial ecosystems of Galapagos. The walk is easy as it is restricted to a few hundred metres of flat
                sandy dunes. This will also be a great opportunity for an introduction to snorkelling.

              <p>
                After breakfast, we disembark (dry landing) at Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, the island’s capital, and drive 40
                minutes to the island’s southern shore. At Cerro Colorado, we visit the breeding centre for highly
                endangered giant tortoises in the midst of a fantastic deciduous forest, home to dozens of bird species,
                including the San Cristobal mockingbird, and the San Cristobal lava lizard, both island endemics.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the afternoon, we disembark (wet landing) on the eastern tip of the island at Punta Pitt, an eroded
                tuff cone, whose trail provides spectacular views of the shoreline. This is the only site in the Galapagos
                where the three species of boobies can be found together. We can walk or enjoy a panga ride along the
                coast. Opportunity for snorkelling, swimming and kayaking.

              <p>
                After breakfast, we take the dinghy over to this idyllic sandy-white beach populated by many sea lions
                (wet landing). The endemic land iguana, unique to this island, may be spotted during the morning walk amid
                the giant prickly pear cactus. Snorkelling and swimming from the panga rounds off our rewarding
                experience, or if guests prefer, the glass bottom boat is available for non-snorkelers. Opportunity for
                kayaking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following lunch and a rest, we disembark (dry landing) in this channel, whose turquoise waters contrast
                brilliantly with the white sand and black lava of the shoreline. Beyond, a carpet of scarlet sesuvium
                succulents serves as groundcover for a grove of luminescent green prickly-pear cactus. Yellow-grey land
                iguanas sit beneath these, waiting patiently for pears to drop. Along the coastline one finds sea lion
                colonies, while frigates, swallow-tailed gulls and shearwaters glide, playing with the thermals.
